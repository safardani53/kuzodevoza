But does Spooky die before the season finale?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Season 3 of <a href=#>On My Block</a> has seen a tumultuous shift in the gang's relationships with each other, and<a href=#> Oscar 'Spooky' Diaz</a>, played by Julio Macias, has promised to be a character to watch out for this season.</p><p>This show is no stranger to killing off its characters. Ruby's cousin, Olivia, met her demise early in Season 1, and Monse's mother also met her early end midway through Season 3. So when Spooky was faced with the odds ahead of him, it didn't look too good. Does Spooky <a href=#>die</a> in Season 3?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Spooky is kidnapped in Episode 7 of 'On My Block.'</h2><p>Season 3 saw the Santos butting heads with a new gang, 19th Street. Just because the Prophet$ are gone didn't mean the Santos' trouble had stopped.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Spooky was always ready to do Cuchillos' bidding for her, but after finding out that she had actually betrayed his father many years before, he was done working for her as faithfully as he had been.</p><p>Instead, Spooky decides it's time to make a deal with 19th Street. He kills Cuchillos before going to the rival gang, who kidnaps him when he comes to make a peace offering.</p><p>While in their captivity, the gang is initially upset that Spooky murdered the woman who made a deal with them. He eventually convinces them that Cuchillos was never going to hold to her word, but that doesn't get him out of hot water with 19th Street just yet.</p><p>At the end of Episode 7, he's being held a gunpoint by the rival gang.</p><p>"Wanna be a shooter or a shot-caller?" his captor asks him.</p><p>"Both, b---h," he tells them, before drawing his own gun.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Spooky die while kidnapped by 19th Street?</h2><p>Fortunately, this is not the end of Spooky's character.</p><p>While Spooky's odds didn't look good, the next time we see him, he's being stitched up, having suffered a few bullet wounds that look painful but aren't life-threatening.</p><p>"You'd be surprised how much of the body can be sewn back together," Ruby's Abuelita tells him.</p><p>We're happy that this wasn't the end of the tough but fatherly Spooky — and his story only gets better from here.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Spooky now?</h2><p>Episode 8, the last in Season 3, ends with a heartwarming two-year flash forward. Spooky has watched over Cesar, Monse, Ruby, Jamal, and Jasmine like they're his own, already showing promise to do better than his father and his grandfather did for him.</p><p>In the flash-forward, Monse has landed a place at a fancy private school, <a href=#>Jasmine</a> and Ruby are still together, and Jamal has become a serious athlete.</p><p>But they're not the only ones who seem to have made it out of the gang life. Spooky had previously expressed his desire to leave it all behind, telling Cesar "I don't need this s--t. I want adult problems. I want to own a house — maybe have a wife, a kid."</p><p>And that's exactly where he ends up. Spooky's flash-forward shows him prepping a backyard barbeque at his own house, his pregnant girlfriend by his side.</p><p>Unfortunately for Cesar, though, he didn't make it out of the gang life. He's currently in charge of Santos, meaning the family's involvement with the gang isn't over just yet. Hopefully, we'll get to see that play out in a potential <a href=#>Season 4</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ysp6inm656pbXEZqanZZ2ueqO4zpyi</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-spooky-die-on-my-block.html&text=%27On%20My%20Block%27s%20%5bSPOILER%5d%20Gets%20the%20Best%20Character%20Arc%20in%20Season%203&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-spooky-die-on-my-block.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-spooky-die-on-my-block.html&title=%27On%20My%20Block%27s%20%5bSPOILER%5d%20Gets%20the%20Best%20Character%20Arc%20in%20Season%203" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-spooky-die-on-my-block.html&title=%27On%20My%20Block%27s%20%5bSPOILER%5d%20Gets%20the%20Best%20Character%20Arc%20in%20Season%203" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-spooky-die-on-my-block.html&title=%27On%20My%20Block%27s%20%5bSPOILER%5d%20Gets%20the%20Best%20Character%20Arc%20in%20Season%203" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-spooky-die-on-my-block.html&description=%27On%20My%20Block%27s%20%5bSPOILER%5d%20Gets%20the%20Best%20Character%20Arc%20in%20Season%203" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./caitlyn-jenner-on-vanity-fair-cover-of-the-year.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Caitlyn Jenner on Vanity Fair: Cover of the Year!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-ed-carpenter-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ed Carpenter Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
