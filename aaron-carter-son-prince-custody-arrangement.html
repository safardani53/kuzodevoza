Just a few months prior to his passing, in September, Aaron lost custody of his 11-month-old son Prince when he voluntarily checked into rehab to overcome addiction, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>which he was very vocal about</a>. At the time, Prince’s mom <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Melanie Martin </strong></a>said&nbsp;that she was dealing with post-partum depression. As a result, the courts ordered that Prince be placed in the temporary custody of Melanie’s mother. And now, two weeks after Aaron’s untimely death, <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has EXCLUSIVELY learned from Aaron’s rep that Prince “is still in the custody of Melanie’s mother and will remain in her custody.” The spokesperson added, “Everyone agrees that he is in the best place for him to be right now.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Although the spokesperson would not comment further, a separate source told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that, prior to his passing, Aaron had planned to “shower Prince with birthday presents” when Prince turns one year old on Nov. 22. “He was really excited to see Prince on his birthday,” the source said. “Aaron’s son is being cared for by Melanie’s mom, who he has been in the custody of for several months now. He had said that being a father was the most amazing thing that happened to him and he was really trying to get his life back in order so that he be a present father to his boy<span>.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>As fans know, Aaron’s relationship with his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on-again, off-again girlfriend</a> Melanie was rocky. In an<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Instagram post</a> on July 22 — two months prior to when Aaron decided to enter an outpatient treatment program — the late <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>brother of Backstreet Boys </a>star&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nick Carter</strong></a>, 42, wrote, “Being a single father is very trying and very difficult but I will never give up on my son and I respect the mother of my child.” Aaron also spoke of his treatment program in an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interview with The Sun</a> at the time. “It’s an abstinence program and I work with an individual counselor. I do group therapy, parenting classes, and domestic violence classes. I got myself certified in CPR, just a lot of different things,” he told the outlet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>When Prince was born, Aaron was present and shared his excitement with his fans <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on Instagram</a> by posting a photo of himself <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cutting the baby’s umbilical cord</a>. Prior to heading to the hospital, Aaron also told his fans that his mom, <strong>Jane</strong>, was equally excited when he posted a screengrab of a conversation that the two were having as he was getting ready. The screengrab showed his mother with a big smile on her face. In the caption, Aaron wrote, “FaceTiming w grandma. My amazing momma get ready to meet your new baby boy.'” The source told us that Aaron’s immediate family is also okay with the current custody arrangement. “Everyone knows that the baby is safe and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> loved by Melanie’s mom</a>,” the insider revealed. “Aaron’s family definitely intends to be involved in Prince’s life and are in contact with Melanie’s mother, who is more than willing to allow his family access to Prince.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Aaron’s body was cremated and his ashes are currently with his twin sister. His cause of death is still being listed as “deferred’ as authorities continue their investigation into the tragedy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BxZpqZoqS7bq%2FAq6ueql2ovK95z6ugp5uVYrC2v9Oom7Jlkae%2ForrGnqSepqRk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2faaron-carter-son-prince-custody-arrangement.html&text=Aaron%20Carters%20Son%20Princes%20Custody%20Arrangements%20Revealed%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faaron-carter-son-prince-custody-arrangement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2faaron-carter-son-prince-custody-arrangement.html&title=Aaron%20Carters%20Son%20Princes%20Custody%20Arrangements%20Revealed%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2faaron-carter-son-prince-custody-arrangement.html&title=Aaron%20Carters%20Son%20Princes%20Custody%20Arrangements%20Revealed%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2faaron-carter-son-prince-custody-arrangement.html&title=Aaron%20Carters%20Son%20Princes%20Custody%20Arrangements%20Revealed%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faaron-carter-son-prince-custody-arrangement.html&description=Aaron%20Carters%20Son%20Princes%20Custody%20Arrangements%20Revealed%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./meryl-streep-kids-4537363.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Facts About Her 4 Children  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./friday-night-lights-cast-where-are-they-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Friday Night Lights' Cast: Where Are They Now?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
