The dancer was world-renowned for his abilities and won numerous competitions in his younger years. In the 2000s, he became a judge on the BBC competition show Strictly Come Dancing,&nbsp;and he then joined Dancing with the Stars in 2005. He was one of the main judges of DWTS from the show’s start until he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced his retirement</a> at the end of season 31. The show will be honoring Len with a special tribute during the October 24 episode. DWTS&nbsp;already renamed the mirrorball trophy to the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy in honor of the ballroom icon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Len’s death in April 2023 was confirmed in a statement obtained by <strong>HollywoodLife.&nbsp;</strong>“It is with great sadness to announce that Len Goodman has passed away peacefully, aged 78. A much loved husband, father and grandfather who will be sorely missed by family, friends and all who knew him,” a rep for the dance legend said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Throughout his life, Len was married twice. His first wife was his dance partner <strong>Cherry Kingston&nbsp;</strong>from 1972 until their divorce was finalized in 1987. After the split, he was in a long-term relationship with a woman named <strong>Lesley</strong>, and they had a son named <strong>James</strong> together. He later remarried <strong>Sue Barrett&nbsp;</strong>in 2012.

The pair welcomed James in January 1981. After Len and Lesley split up, she reportedly brought the pair’s son back to her hometown of the Isle of Wight, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GH Gossip.&nbsp;</a></p><h2>James Is Also a Dancer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>With his father being one of the most beloved dancers of all time, James followed in his dad’s footsteps and became an exceptional dancer himself. James was trained in both Latin and ballroom styles, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>. Like his father, he also occasionally worked as a judge in other dance competitions.</p><h2>James Has Worked as a Dance Instructor</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>With his skills, James dedicated himself to becoming an instructor in both Latin and ballroom styles of dance at his dad’s<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Goodman Dance Center</a>. James explained that he felt he was able to teach anyone, even those who may not be inclined to dance the basics of the art form. “James Goodman is a Latin and Ballroom dance teacher, whose aim is to make dance accessible and fun to everyone, even those with two left feet,” his bio on his site said.</p><h2>James Has Joked About His Father’s Tough Judgments</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>While Len’s sharp humor was<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> a staple of&nbsp;DWTS,&nbsp;</a>James revealed he was a bit of an easier judge when deciding a charity dance competition in Northhampton, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun.</a>&nbsp;“I am much more generous with my marks than Len,” he promised the competitors.</p><h2>James Is a Father to 2 Children</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Outside of dancing, James is married to his wife, <strong>Sophie,&nbsp;</strong>and they’re proud parents to two children. They had their daughter&nbsp;<strong>Alice&nbsp;</strong>in 2015, and they welcomed a son&nbsp;<strong>Dan&nbsp;</strong>in 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8uepWafn6Sxrq3NZqqopl1qfXl8lWxqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flen-goodman-son-5080633.html&text=All%20About%20His%20Only%20Child%20James%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flen-goodman-son-5080633.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flen-goodman-son-5080633.html&title=All%20About%20His%20Only%20Child%20James%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flen-goodman-son-5080633.html&title=All%20About%20His%20Only%20Child%20James%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flen-goodman-son-5080633.html&title=All%20About%20His%20Only%20Child%20James%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flen-goodman-son-5080633.html&description=All%20About%20His%20Only%20Child%20James%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./first-picture-of-man-stabbed-to-death-in-county-durham.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="First picture of 25-year-old man stabbed to death in County Durham as police arrest man, 25, over mu">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sam-neill-married.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Jurassic Park' Star Sam Neill Keeps His Offscreen Live Private  Was He Ever Married?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
