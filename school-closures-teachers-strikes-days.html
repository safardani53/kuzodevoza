below the legal threshold of 50%.</p><p>Union bosses last night gave the Government two weeks to up their pay offer or face huge disruption next month.</p><p>But they were slammed for hurting pupils still scrambling to catch up after&nbsp;<a href=#>lockdown</a>.</p><p>Cabinet Minister&nbsp;<a href=#>Mark Harper</a>&nbsp;warned more time out of lessons was “the last thing” kids needed.</p><p>He blasted: “Any strikes, anything disrupting children’s&nbsp;<a href=#>education</a>, would be very regrettable.”</p><p>The prospect of school strikes comes as teachers in Scotland today began 16 days of strike action.</p><p>Meanwhile, ambulance workers, nurses and rail staff remain locked in major pay disputes with the government.</p><p>Last week thousands of&nbsp;<a href=#>ambulance workers walked out</a>&nbsp;of work for the second time in one month.</p><p>And on Wednesday thousands of nurses will withdraw their labour from the NHS.</p><p>School strikes are set to leave hard-pressed parents either forking out for childcare or taking time off work.</p><p>Former teacher and&nbsp;<a href=#>Tory</a>&nbsp;MP Brendan Clarke-Smith said: “Children and their parents shouldn’t have to suffer because of the politicised actions of left-wing union leaders.</p><p>“I’m sure most teachers agree, which is why the recent NASUWT strike ballot failed to reach the required threshold.</p><p>“Other groups such as the NEU now need to realise that too, rather than playing politics with the prospects of our pupils.</p><p>“Unions also need to consider the effect this will have on childcare and therefore the wider economy.”</p><p>Conservative MP Miriam Cates added: “I think teacher strikes would be absolutely appalling, especially after the pandemic.</p><p>“If we didn’t have clear evidence on the harms of missing school before Covid, then we certainly do now — and to knowingly put children through that again is morally wrong.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>The independent Children’s Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souz said she's "disappointed" with today's result.</p><p>“I know the decision to strike will not have been taken lightly for any teacher, and the vote has been far from unanimous - but it comes in the wake of huge disruption from the pandemic and will add to the challenges already faced by so many pupils who are catching up on lost learning.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“I urge those choosing to take industrial action to take all possible steps to minimise the impact on children and families.</p><p>“I am grateful to all those teachers and support staff who continue to prioritise their pupils’ wellbeing and I want to see an end to the dispute as soon as possible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/held-rally-teachers-take-strike-788973151.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ35yhJhubGtno5i1sLvLZpqlp6Oqv6a%2FjK2cmpuYmr%2B0edKtqaKjlah6pa3YrGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fschool-closures-teachers-strikes-days.html&text=Full%20list%20of%20school%20closures%20as%20teachers%20launch%20string%20of%20strikes%20in%20days&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fschool-closures-teachers-strikes-days.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fschool-closures-teachers-strikes-days.html&title=Full%20list%20of%20school%20closures%20as%20teachers%20launch%20string%20of%20strikes%20in%20days" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fschool-closures-teachers-strikes-days.html&title=Full%20list%20of%20school%20closures%20as%20teachers%20launch%20string%20of%20strikes%20in%20days" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fschool-closures-teachers-strikes-days.html&title=Full%20list%20of%20school%20closures%20as%20teachers%20launch%20string%20of%20strikes%20in%20days" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fschool-closures-teachers-strikes-days.html&description=Full%20list%20of%20school%20closures%20as%20teachers%20launch%20string%20of%20strikes%20in%20days" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./perry-saturn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Perry Saturn">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./michael-connelly-illinois-politician.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Michael Connelly (Illinois politician) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
