The two-time Oscar and Golden Globe winner has been acting for more than 40 years — and is well known for his work in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Field of Dreams</a>, Dances with Wolves, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The Bodyguard</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Hidden Figures</a> and The Highwaymen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Costner stepped into John Dutton's boots in 2017. But at one point, long before cameras were rolling, the actor felt reluctant about taking the job.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I was approached with this, it was going to be a 10-episode movie," he explained on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Popcorn with Peter Travers</a>. "Suddenly, it was going to be a multi-season thing. I had to make a real fundamental decision there. I thought if I said, 'Now I'm not doing it,' it might have crumbled before it got started. I took the weight on emotionally of not wanting the show to crumble."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Five seasons later and Costner has exceeded all expectations as the patriarch of the Dutton family — a man fighting for his land and his legacy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love working in this genre," he shared. "There's a musical dance that I feel when I do a western.

I'm just twiddling my thumbs," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor shares three adult children — Annie, Lily and Joe — with his ex-wife Cindy Silva, and son Liam with former partner Bridget Rooney.
