So we’ve had a bit of a rough day," she said. She also said that she was in her "anger phase" and was "so mad" at him.</p><p>“I did everything right so [Kobe] wouldn’t have any trauma and he just left her with a lifetime full of it," she continued. She also said that Kobe knew her dad had died, and that she would be taking time off of school.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Kelsey also shared that Kobe was having a "yes day" where she would get anything she asked for. She also said that Kobe's grief was coming in waves, and she was glad to be with her so that they should be together when the waves hit. Kobe's stepdad Curtis Woods is also with them, and is supporting her through this.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kobe's father was named Devin Williams.</h2><p>Although Kelsey took pains not to reveal Kobe's dad's identity, the news has broken that his name is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Devin Williams</a>. Unfortunately, outside of the news around his death, not much is known about Devin.</p><p>Kelsey had discussed their strained relationship in the past but had suggested in recent months that they had come to a better understanding of how to parent Kobe together.
