I’m on a soap and then you have to have an ambulance come and roll me out on a gurney.’&nbsp;</p><p>“It was pretty, pretty ridiculous. I was really embarrassed.”</p><p>General Hospital star Kathleen Gati (Dr. Liesl Obrecht) also had an embarrassing personal story to share.</p><p>She shared with the magazine: “About 30 years ago, I was living in Manhattan on the fifth floor of a walk-up building. My neighbor called me frantically to say there were people in my apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>“I immediately called the police. The place was a disaster — clothes everywhere, drawers opened and ransacked. But we found no sign of a forced entry.”&nbsp;</p><p>After looking around for a while with the cops, nothing appeared to be missing.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>It was only after the police left and she'd looked around a bit longer that she realized all of the chaos was her own doing.</p><p>“I realized that I had made that big mess in the morning when I had rushed to get ready for work,” Kathleen said. “My neighbor must have heard someone on the roof.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/www-instagram-com-p-cjs3zzzrmpa-769326072.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/www-instagram-com-p-be3nebunlyo-769326074.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZG1%2FdoGSaKCnq5mZsm6uzqWbZpqVlsK1tcWuo2ark6TBtXnCpaCfrJ%2Bjeq21wKZkrKeRpXqttcWeZKCqkaOxp63ToZyrZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-bold-beautiful-scott-clifton-liam-soap-life-grandfather.html&text=Inside%20The%20Bold%20and%20the%20Beautiful%20star%20Scott%20Clifton%27s%20wild%20%27real%20soap%20opera%20life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-bold-beautiful-scott-clifton-liam-soap-life-grandfather.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-bold-beautiful-scott-clifton-liam-soap-life-grandfather.html&title=Inside%20The%20Bold%20and%20the%20Beautiful%20star%20Scott%20Clifton%27s%20wild%20%27real%20soap%20opera%20life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-bold-beautiful-scott-clifton-liam-soap-life-grandfather.html&title=Inside%20The%20Bold%20and%20the%20Beautiful%20star%20Scott%20Clifton%27s%20wild%20%27real%20soap%20opera%20life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-bold-beautiful-scott-clifton-liam-soap-life-grandfather.html&title=Inside%20The%20Bold%20and%20the%20Beautiful%20star%20Scott%20Clifton%27s%20wild%20%27real%20soap%20opera%20life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-bold-beautiful-scott-clifton-liam-soap-life-grandfather.html&description=Inside%20The%20Bold%20and%20the%20Beautiful%20star%20Scott%20Clifton%27s%20wild%20%27real%20soap%20opera%20life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./julio-pena-20000715-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Julio Pea (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nolite-te-bastardes-carborundorum-meaning-the-handmaids-tale.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="&amp;quot;Nolite Te Bastardes Carborundorum&amp;quot; Is Still Important on 'The Handmaid's Tale'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
