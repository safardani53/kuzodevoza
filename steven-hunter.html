His parents’ names, on the other hand, are still unknown.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, Steven’s mother has served on the Chicago Board of Education for 35 years, while his father is a Vietnam veteran.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, because his father was a vet, he was strict in the family and wouldn’t let his brother or him do anything wrong, and it was great to have him around.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven’s parents are still a married pair living happily in Chicago, with a strong bond.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He grew up following the Chicago Bulls from an early age, and he recalls a player in the 90s wearing the number 23 jersey, <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Steven-Hunter-family.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Michele Jordan was his motivation, and Jordan was the athlete he most admired and idolized. His goal to play in the NBA came from his wish to see himself on the same court as his idol.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He slowly liked the game and began playing basketball at a young age, practicing diligently every day. Basketball became more than a passion for him; it became an obsession to win.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven feels that his mentors, parents, and supportive friends are responsible for his success as a professional basketball player, which he began playing at the age of three.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven Hunter| Career</span></h2><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Early Career</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven went to Proviso East High School for his early education. Proviso East is where he spends most of his time playing basketball.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Famous NBA players like Sherell Ford, Michel Finley, and others graduated from the school, making it well-known for basketball.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After completing his high school education, he enrolled at DePaul University, located in Chicago, where he spent two years playing basketball.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, Steven proclaimed himself ready for the 2011 NBA Draft after his undergraduate season.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NBA Career</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Beginning his NBA career at the age of 20, Steven, as a rookie, played against Chicago Bulls and made a victory 102-74.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, next year in 2002, with Orlando Magic, Steven injured his anterior cruciate ligament during a training camp. Because of his injury, he was out for 49 games and could not complete the 2002-03 season.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In the 2004-05 seasons, Steven played as Phoenix Suns. His game with the Suns against Memphis Grizzlies made him average his career-high 16 points in a 114-103 win.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven led his teams to the western conference finals as Suns before losing to Spurs.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hunter also signed a free-agent agreement with the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2005 offseason. In 2006 and 2007, he was traded to the New Orleans Hornets for two second-round draft selections.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, as of the 2007 season, Steven was traded to Denver Nuggets along with Bobby Jones by the 76ers on September 10.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After playing with the Nuggets for the 2007-08 seasons, Hunter was later traded to Memphis Grizzlies by the Nuggets with the lottery Protected 2010 first-round pick.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In his last time in NBA before his retirement, he signed a contract with Dinamo Sassari located in Italy.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven Hunter is now the Steven Hunter Basketball Academy CEO, and he is no longer a professional basketball player. In 2014, he was also named the Phoenix Suns’ community ambassador.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven Hunter | Age, Weight & Height</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Let’s have a look at Steven Hunter’s physical features.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven Hunter, a veteran player, is now 42 years old. It’s incredible to see how he’s aging yet still managing to stay athletic and healthy.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, Steven has been playing basketball since he was three years old, and as an athlete himself, he understands the value of fitness in sports.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hunter is a tall athlete, standing about 7 feet.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, while he was a player, his height was a gift, allowing him to score easily on a basketball hoop. Still, now that he is no longer a player and living a regular life, he believes his height is occasionally a problem.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Steven.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, his natural solid advantage of being tall has helped him to be in the NBA, but his work ethic is also why he was being chosen out of few.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven believes that being tall has many advantages, but that is not always the case. So he practiced his dark abilities and worked hard in general to become a basketball player, which he believes is what sets him apart from other prominent men.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, his passion for basketball drives him to play and get on the court even when sometimes he does not feel like doing it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In addition, Steven is fit and healthy, weighing 240 pounds, thanks to his daily workouts and training.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven Hunter| Net Worth&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven has earned enough money to live peacefully with his family after playing with several NBA teams and being drafted based on his ability.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Speaking of his total net worth, it’s impossible to determine his actual net worth, although it’s estimated to be at the $3 million level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In addition, his overall earnings as a member of several basketball teams amount to $30,149,949.

Blaise, the firstborn, was diagnosed with autism at three years old.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven and his wife, Erika, found it difficult to witness their first child’s autism. Both parents were devastated at first, unsure of what to do.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, Steven gradually sought assistance and support from a community organization called the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center. At the same time, Erika began working as a teacher in their son’s special school.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Steven-with-his-wife.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On February 15, the duo celebrated their 13th valentine’s Day together at Maple & Ash restaurant, and Steven </span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>posted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true> on his Facebook account.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven adores his family and lives by the concept of “family first.” Steven, who retired in his 30s, has spent all of his time with his family and is happy about it.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven Hunter Youth Foundations&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Knowing the struggle they had and seeing how public school resources can be scary is how Steven came up with Steven Hunter Youth Foundation.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Foundation’s vision is to become Arizona’s finest and most dependable non-profit organization specializing in youth sports and special needs assistance.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steven paid for school and other needy students out of his wallet. Erika believes that the foundation should be a location where individuals in need may readily come and receive assistance.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, the organization is concerned with Autism, and it has a program called “Father United for Kids with Autism.” This allows children and parents to connect and share their personal experiences and

player for ten years, has admitted that he still gets butterflies before entering the floor and playing.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As a result, after retiring, he founded Steven Hunter Life Skills & Basketball Academy, where he coached before his kid was born.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;The Academy motto is “The Universe has a way of rewarding those
