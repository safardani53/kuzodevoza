The more expensive designs tend to be sturdier and will last longer, though there’s no shame in buying budget chairs if you’re only going to be using them occasionally.</p><p>On that, one important thing to consider before investing in camping chairs is where you’re going to store them, as some designs (though folding) still take up a fair amount of space.</p><p>You’ll also need to think about how comfortable you want to be – many camping chairs sit lower to the ground than normal chairs so can be tricky to get out of, and some aren’t padded so can become uncomfortable after a while.</p><p>Our round-up of portable camping chairs brings you some of the most popular designs out there...</p><p>This article and featured products have been independently chosen by Sun journalists.

Savvy Outdoors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/one-savvy-girl-backpack-cooling-chair.jpg><li><strong>(AD) Ultralight backpack cooling chair, £53.55 from Amazon – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><p>Take your seating and a cold drink wherever you need to go with this jazzy three-in-one design, which converts from a lightweight backpack to a folding camping stool with a built-in cooler bag – amazing!</p><p>We reckon it’s ideal for pitchside football supporters and outdoor concerts, and one enthusiastic Amazon reviewer even recommended it as an excellent chair for outdoor queuing.</p><p>The backpack weighs just three pounds (without beers, ahem) and is simple to set up and fold down again.</p><h2>2. <span id=eiiudg-dd-anchor class="base hover" data-ui-id=page-title-wrapper data-toggle=pricematchDropdown data-is-focus=false data-yeti-box=pricematchDropdown>Vango Titan 2</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chqtitane27z06-excalibur-vango-titan-ii-chair-1_1.jpg><li><strong>Vango Titan 2, £54.99 from Winfields Outdoors - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><p>The Vango Titan 2 is regarded as one of the best camping chairs out there, and for good reasons. It's set to be comfortable thanks to its opulent padding and half-moon design.</p><p>However, it weights around 6kg, meaning you won't be able to carry it around for long.</p><h2>3. Robens</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bl_350879_a.jpg><li><strong>Robens Strider Chair, £27.50 from Millets -<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> buy here</a></strong></li><p>Looking for something extremely portable?

Check out this Trespass Folding Tripod stool.</p><p>This stool could be a great choice thanks to its weight (0.73 kg) and folding abilities. When packed, the Trespass chair is no larger than an umbrella, meaning it won't take too much space in your backpack.</p><p>That makes it a truly versatile option - and a bargain too.</p><h2>5. Yellowstone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Yellowstone-Castleton-Outdoor-Camping-Chair.jpg><li><strong>Castleton camping chair, £25.99 from eBay – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><p>This camping chair from Yellowstone weighs 4.3kg, which is a little heavier than some other camping chairs.</p><p>But users do&nbsp; praise it for its strength and stability, so if that's key for you take note.</p><p>The Castleton camping chair also gets top marks for comfort, and should support all sizes.</p><h2>6. Kingcamp</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kingcamp-folding-moon-chair.jpg><li><strong>(AD) Folding camping moon chair, £59.99 from Amazon – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><p>This large comfy lounge-style chair is great for longer stints outdoors, such as camping and fishing trips, as well as sunny afternoons in the garden.</p><p>The bracket structure of the high-strength metal tubing and the tough cord fabric make this design super stable (the chair can support 120kg).</p><p>The chair itself weighs 10.4 pounds and folds up into a carry bag, so you can stash it neatly in the car boot.</p><h2>7. Kelty</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kelty-low-loveseat-chair.jpg><li><strong>(AD) Low loveseat camping chair, £90 from Amazon – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><p>Why have a single camping chair when you can emulate your sofa at home with this loveseat camping chair for two (plus the dog of course)?</p><p>Get comfy on the low-slung, slightly reclining design, and use the insulated slots in the armrest for your beverage of choice.</p><p>“Didn’t know how much I needed this until I bought it,” said one Amazon customer in their review.</p><p>“Amazing having a love seat, both for sharing, and for one person lounging in style and comfort around a campfire”.</p><h2>8. Quechua</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/quechua-folding-camping-chair.jpg><li><strong>Basic folding camping chair, £9.99 from Decathlon – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><p>If you’re looking for a no-frills camping chair from a decent brand, then this lightweight folding chair from Quechua could be just the ticket: with over 4,800 five-star reviews on the Decathlon site, it’s pretty hard to beat.</p><p>The chair is easy to set up and take down, and features a comfy seat, arm rests and the all-important cup holder.</p><p>You probably can’t do much better for a tenner.</p><h2>9. Eurohike</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/millets-lazy-lounger.jpg><li><strong>Lazy Lounger inflatable chair, £17 from Go Outdoors – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><p>Robust and surprisingly comfortable, this inflatable lounger from Eurohike will be a massive hit with the kids on your next camping trip or day in the park.</p><p>There’s a bit of a knack to inflating it - you ‘catch’ air into it by waving it about - and you’ll also need to work out what the perfect level of inflation is for your specific lounging requirements.</p><p>Once you’re done reclining, just squish the air out of it, roll it up and fold it into its compact carry bag to store until the next time you need it.</p><h2>10. Vango <strong>Hampton deluxe</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vango-hampton-deluxe-reclining-chair.jpg><li><strong>Hampton deluxe reclining chair, £48.50 from Go Outdoors – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><p>When comfort is the main priority, there are two things you need to look out for in a camping chair: a high reclining back and a padded seat.</p><p>This smart deluxe chair from Vango has both.</p><p>It also features a built-in padded headrest which can be removed and used as a lumbar support if necessary, giving you the option to further customise your comfort.</p><p>The chair folds flat for easy storage and transportation on the floor of your car boot.</p><h2>11. Argos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/argos-home-folding-picnic-chair.jpg><li><strong>Argos Home metal folding picnic chair, £10 from Argos – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><p>The basic fold-out design of this picnic chair from Argos has been around since the seventies and it’s still going strong.</p><p>It’s the perfect chair for outdoor cinema, barbecues, camping and trips to the seaside, and at this price, you’ll be able to afford one for everybody in the family.</p><p>If you want to use the chairs in your garden, it’s good to know that Argos has also produced a folding sunlounger (£28), deckchair (£38) and a garden parasol (£18), all in the same jolly Ipanema Fruit print.</p><h2>12. Therm-A-Rest</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thermarest-trekking-chair.jpg><li><strong>Trekker chair 20, £32.50 from Jackson Sport – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><p>When you’re going hiking or trekking and are carrying everything you need with you, you’ll know that every ounce counts.</p><p>But, if you’re already taking a Thermorest NeoAir self-inflating camping mat with you (or another similar camping mat), you’ll be able to treat yourself to the luxury of a chair for just 290g extra if you invest in this neat Trekker camping chair.</p><p>It’s a clever design that uses ultralight nylon and fibreglass poles to convert your camping mat into a surprisingly comfortable chair – sheer luxury after a long day’s hiking.</p><h2>13. <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">KingCamp</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/71QWco5f-qL._AC_SL1500_.jpg><li><strong>(Ad) KingCamp Low Sling Chair, £44.99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><p>If you're going to a festival or a beach trip, a low sling chair might be perfect.</p><p>Weighing 3kg, the KingCamp Low Sling chair has a sturdy structure and a mesh back, aiming to keep you cool while you're using it.</p><p>The chair has received a lot of positive reviews, with one customer claiming:</p><p>"You can comfortably sit in these chairs for hours, to converse, read, sunbathe or watch a film."</p><h2>Where to buy camping chairs?</h2><p>There are plenty of retailers who sell camping chairs, and you can often find them on third party seller websites such as Amazon.</p><p>However, many campers purchase their camping chair from retailers specialising in outdoor equipment like Go Outdoors, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Millets</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Decathlon</a>.</p><p>Specialist outdoor clothing and equipment retailers often have highly-qualified advisors who can help you to choose the right product for your needs.</p><h2>How much does a camping chair weigh?</h2><p>There's no one single answer about how much does a camping chair weigh since it comes down to an individual model.</p><p>Normally, a light camping chair weighs less than a kilo, and it can go up to six kilograms, depending on the types of materials used in the chair making.</p><p>It's important that you choose a chair that would suit you and your camping habits.</p><p>If you're a passionate hiker who enjoys a several days trip, you might want something light and compact.</p><p>Going with a car? You can allow yourself to pack something heavier and more comfortable.</p><h2>Can you take a camping chair on a plane?</h2><p>If you want to take a camping chair on a plane you'll need to check your chair's length, height, and width to comply with the airline's baggage policy.</p><p>Make sure to do your measurements in advance to avoid fees at the airport, if your camping chair exceeds allowed baggage dimensions.</p><p>Different airlines have different hand baggage requirements, so have that in mind as well.</p><p>Additionally, you can bag your camping chair into a check-in suitcase prior to your flight.</p><h2>How to keep a camping chair from sinking</h2><p>We know how uncomfortable it is to sit on a chair that keeps sinking in the sand.</p><p>But, luckily, there are handy items you can purchase now to solve the sinking issue.</p><p>We'd suggest getting the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">'Chair buddies'</a> if you want to use your camping chair on the sand, to prevent it from sinking in.</p><p>They are handy attachments to your chair legs that improve the chair's stability on soft ground (on either sand, mud, grass, or snow), by increasing chair feet surface area.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More in Sun Selects Home</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our round-up of the best camping chairs?
