With Children aired its finale. The 80s and 90s television show has remained one of the longest-running shows, airing for 10 consecutive years. Its various spin-offs received mild success, but nothing compares to the original.</p><p>So where is the cast of Married.. With Children now? Here's a look at where the leading members are now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ed O'Neill (Al Bundy)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Ed O'Neill ended his role as the patriarch of Married...
