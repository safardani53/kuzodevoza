She was affiliated with the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO) and joined Cypress Elite when she was 14.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mother-daughter.webp><p><span>During her high school at the Diamond Bar High School, she was a three-time All-league pick. The National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) also named her All-American.</span></p><p><span>Known for her speed and sprinting abilities, she played for the Olympic Development Program (ODP).</span></p><p><span>Morgan was just 17 when the United States under-20 women’s national soccer team called her up.</span></p><p><span>After completing high school, she continued her education and attended the University of California, Berkeley.</span></p><p><span>There, she played for the university women’s soccer team, California Golden Bears. She ended her time at college well, achieving academic and sporting success.</span></p><h2><span>Professional Club Career: Time In The US & Elsewhere</span></h2><p><span>Alex has played soccer all over the US and the world. She has always been a player in demand, and her track record shows that she tends to become the leading player of the team, no matter where she plays.</span></p><p><span>Right after graduation from UC Berkeley, Alex Morgan was picked as the first overall pick in the 2011 Women’s Professional Soccer Draft.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/301956400_1165657177379837_1160105702144788149_n.jpg><p><span>This draft made her the first Cal player to be drafted in the first round of WPS. The team to pick her? The Western New York Flash.</span></p><h3><span>A Short-lived Time With The Seattle Sounders Women</span></h3><p><span>Alex Morgan joined the Seattle Sounders Women for the 2012 USL W-League season.</span></p><p><span>However, she made only three regular-season appearances, but</span><span>&nbsp;those were three explosive appearances.</span></p><h3><span>Two Years With The Portland Thorns FC</span></h3><p><span>On the 11th of January 2013, Alex Morgan joined the Portland Thorns FC through the NWSL Player Allocation. It was the first season of the National Women’s Soccer League in the US.</span></p><p><span>Morgan ended the 2013 season as the highest points scorer for the team with 21 points and the joint-highest goal scorer for the team alongside Christine Sinclair with eight goals and five assists.</span></p><p><span>She also won the inaugural championship title with the Thorns and was named in the NWSL Second eleven.</span></p><h3><span>Two Stints With The Orlando Pride</span></h3><p><span>The Portland Thorns traded Alex Morgan to Orlando pride on the 26th of October, 2015. She could only score four goals in her 15 appearances for the Pride during the 2016 NWSL season.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/alex-mg.jpg><p><span>The left-footed champion returned to the Pride for the 2017 season and stayed there till 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>First Experience In Europe With Lyon</span></h3><p><span>Between her two stints with Orlando Pride, Morgan spent briefly in Europe with Lyon. Lyon confirmed her signing on the 5th of January, 2017.</span></p><p><span>This was her first time experiencing the professional soccer scene on the other side of the Atlantic.</span></p><h3><span>Return To Europe With Tottenham Hotspur</span></h3><p><span>On the 12th of September 2020, Alex Morgan </span><span>signed </span><span>a very short-term contract with the English FA Women’s Super League team Tottenham Hotspur.</span></p><p><span>The initial contract ran from September 2020 to December 2020.</span></p><h3>Back To Orlando</h3><p>Morgan returned to her former team Orlando Pride before the 2021 season. She made her first appearance on April 21, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>In May 2021, Alex was named NWSL Player of the Month for the second time in her career.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=San_Diego_Wave_FC_(2022–present) class=mw-headline>San Diego Wave&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Club San Diego Wave signed Alex in December 2021. The star athlete has been playing for the team ever since.&nbsp;</p><h2><span>International Soccer Career With The USWNT</span></h2><p><span>It is rarely the case that soccer player scores more goals with their national team than in their club career. Alex Morgan is one of those exceptions.</span></p><p><span>She has more goals and a better game-to-goal ratio while playing for the United States Women’s National Team than she has in her club career.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/alex-m.jpg><p><span>The striker, who wears a jersey with the number 13 for the USWNT, has represented the US at different levels of international soccer. She first played for the Under-20 US national team.</span></p><p><span>Alex made her senior team debut in March 2010. She played in various tournaments and gathered many accolades in her and her team’s names over the years.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Other Activities Besides Professional Soccer</span></h2><p><span>Alex has dabbled in other areas of interest as well. She is a writer, model, and sports diplomat, among other things.</span></p><h3><span>Books</span></h3><p><span>Morgan has written several books on soccer, leadership, and friendship, targeting middle schoolers.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/E26064.jpg><p>Some of her books are Switching Goals, Fans In The Stand, Win Or lose, Choosing Sides, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><span>Sports Diplomacy</span></h3><p><span>Morgan has also been involved in sports diplomacy in the past. She traveled to Tanzania as a part of a sports envoy of the U.S. State Department’s Sports Diplomacy office.</span></p><p><span>There, she visited schools and organized soccer clinics to promote gender equality.</span></p><h3><span>Modeling</span></h3><p><span>Morgan is not only a person blessed with magic in her feet but also with gorgeous looks. Therefore, her appearance in various magazines does not seem like such a far-fetched thing.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/alex-morgan-cover.png><p><span>The USWNT striker has appeared in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, ESPN The Magazine, Health, Vogue, Elle, Forbes, Time, and Fortune magazines, to name a few.</span></p><h2><span>Net Worth, Salary, & Earnings</span></h2><p>Alex has a net worth of about $5.7 million as of 2023. She ranked 19th in the Forbes 2022 Highest-Paid Female Athletes.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Women soccer players, not even those at the very top of their game like Morgan, command as high salaries as their male counterparts. However, this does not mean that Morgan does not still earn a decent amount of money.</span></p><p><span>It has been </span><span>reported </span><span>that during her time with THE French team Lyon, she received a hefty salary of around $33 thousand per month.</span></p><p><span>However, it isn’t her yearly soccer salary that makes up most of her income. It is her endorsement deals with various successful companies like AT&T, Panasonic, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, P&G, etc., that pays well. </span><span>The&nbsp;deals are worth $5 million.</span></p><h2><span>Personal Life: Husband, Daughter, & Wedding</span></h2><p><span>Sadly for her male fans, Alex Morgan is taken. She is married to soccer player Servando Carrasco and has a cute daughter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Morgan </span><span>met </span><span>Carrasco at the University of California, Berkeley. Both played soccer, and their love for the same game probably brought them together.</span></p><p><span>While dating, their professional lives took them to opposite ends of the country. In 2011, Carrasco played for the Seattle Sounders while Morgan was with the Western New York Flash.</span></p><p><span>However, they stuck with each other, and the bond strengthened. Carrasco proposed to Morgan at Manhattan Beach in California in December of 2013.</span></p><p><span>The couple stayed engaged for a year before finally tying the knot on the 31st of December 2014 in Santa Barbara, California.</span></p><p><span>Due to their soccer career, the couple had to stay separate even after marrying each other.</span></p><p><span>In October 2019, the couple announced they were expecting their first baby. They </span><span>welcomed their daughter</span><span>, Charlie Elene Carrasco, on the 7th of May 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Social Media Presence</span></h2><p><span>One of the perks of being arguably the best women’s soccer player in the game’s history is that you have many fans. The same is the case here, as Alex Morgan has a massive following on social media.</span></p><p><strong>Instagram</strong>: 9.8 Million&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Twitter</strong>: 3.8 Million&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Facebook</strong>: 6.2 Million&nbsp;</p><h2>Popularity&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Alex-Morgan-1.jpg><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Why is Alex Morgan called baby horse?</h3><p>Alex is called baby horse because of her long strides that mimics a horse’s gallop.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCty56vZqWfp7Siuo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falex-morgan.html&text=Alex%20Morgan%20Bio%3a%20Net%20Worth%2c%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%5b2023%20Update%5d&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falex-morgan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falex-morgan.html&title=Alex%20Morgan%20Bio%3a%20Net%20Worth%2c%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%5b2023%20Update%5d" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falex-morgan.html&title=Alex%20Morgan%20Bio%3a%20Net%20Worth%2c%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%5b2023%20Update%5d" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falex-morgan.html&title=Alex%20Morgan%20Bio%3a%20Net%20Worth%2c%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%5b2023%20Update%5d" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falex-morgan.html&description=Alex%20Morgan%20Bio%3a%20Net%20Worth%2c%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%5b2023%20Update%5d" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cody-mckay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cody McKay">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./best-christmas-bedding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="9 Best Christmas Bedding Sets 2021 | The Sun UK">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
