We're so happy," she gushed. "It's just, like, every day we learn more and more about each other, and we honestly fall more and more in love with each other."</p><p><a href=#>Cameron</a> posted a photo from their wedding day, simply captioning the pic, "The happiest day of my life."</p><p>Then in the reunion show, they proved they were still going strong.</p><p class=body-text>They recently celebrated their second wedding anniversary on November 16, 2020, and are still going strong.</p><p class=body-text>Lauren shared an adorable tribute on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>: "Wow 2 whoooole years!
