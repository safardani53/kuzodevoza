However, it was not until <i>1996</i>, he joined paths with friend Sean '&nbsp;Lord Tariq' Hamilton, a.k.a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Tariq, and created duo&nbsp;<i>Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz</i>. Together, the pair released numerous singles and albums like and <i>Deja Vu&nbsp;</i>(Uptown Baby).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Deja Vu&nbsp;(Uptown Baby) is certainly his most popular song. However, the release of the song was not so smooth. After the release of the single, King of Hip-hop, <a href=#>P Diddy</a> tried to blacklist the song claiming that the song was copied from the<strong> Lox</strong>'s It as both the songs had similar beats. However, it was not the case as the song was pre-recorded and had been stacked up for years before its release.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After collaborating with many singers, he decided to go solo but that did not work for him. He recorded a solo album under the name <i>Othello </i>but the song was never released.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After the incident, his career went downhill, and he was broke at one point. So, to make a living, he started appearing on TV shows like&nbsp;<i>Son of a Gun </i>and&nbsp;<i>Love & Hip Hop</i>.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><h2>Peter Gunz relationships, marriage, and children</h2><p>The first public relationship of Peter Gunz was with reality TV contestant<strong> Tara Wallace</strong>. The two had an almost perfect correlation. They started dating in 2000, and from their relationship, they have three children <strong>Jamison, Jaz</strong> and <strong>Gunner Ethan</strong>. However, they separated after being together for 13 years.&nbsp;The reason behind their split was claimed to be Gunz's infidelity.&nbsp; He reportedly was in a relationship with a German singer,&nbsp;<a href=#>Amina Buddafly</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><img alt="Peter Gunz and ex-girlfriend Tara Wallace" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvdeets.com/media/2016/07/tara-wallace-peter-gunz.jpeg ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Peter Gunz and ex-girlfriend Tara Wallace<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The split was quite sad as Gunz himself said that Tara was perfect, but he was the one with all the problems.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After his split with Tara, he got married to the German singer&nbsp;whom he worked with and also released a song together in the same year.
