There are a lot of call outs and demands for people to be held accountable for their actions. There have been a lot of shake-ups on reality television with cast members fired for things they've said or written.</p><p>And content creators on YouTube are not invisible in this. What happened between Fed and Yvonne from <a href=#>Offline TV</a>? It's another incident of people being held accountable.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Fed and Yvonne?</h2><p>Both Fed and Yvonne are members of Offline TV, which is an online social entertainment group of content creators based in Los Angeles. Together, along with other content creators, they produce a wide variety of YouTube videos from playing games, to pranking each other, and daily vlogs, all done from the home where they all live. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>There have been several members throughout the Offline TV career since it was launched in 2017, but as of until recent, members include Scarra, LilyPichu, Yvonne, Fedmyster (Fed), Disguised Toast, and Michael Reeves.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>🥰🥰🥰</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>OfflineTV</a> (@offlinetvgg) on May 12, 2020 at 1:36pm PDT</p></figure><p>But there was a shake up on June 27 after allegations surfaced regarding one of the cast members. He was accused of harassment against two fellow members of Offline TV and he was fired.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened between Fed and Yvonne?</h2><p>On June 27, fellow Offline TV members Yvonne "Yvonnie" Ng and Lily "LilyPichu" Ki came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Fedmyster, whose real name is Federico Michael Gaytan.&nbsp;</p><p>Yvonne came forward on Twitter sharing "my truth" and outlining several instances accusing Fed of sexual harassment. &nbsp;</p><p>"I wanna start this off by saying, Fed was the first friend I felt like I made at Offline TV," Yvonne said. "He was very welcoming and I spent the most time with him out of everyone. We got along really well and quickly became really really good friends."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>my truth</p><p>Read: <a href=#>https://t.co/YUf10unFpd</a></p>— yvonne 🌸 (@yvonnie) <a href=#>June 28, 2020</a></figure><p>She then outlined that, on two separate instances, Fed entered her room uninvited, laid on her bed, and touched her inappropriately. After confronting him several times, she said he would claim that he did not remember what had happened the night before.&nbsp;</p><p>"I kept this secret to myself for a very very long time," she said. "The only people I could tell were my boyfriend at the time and a close friend of mine, and out of respect for me they didn't tell anyone."</p><p>In her statement, Yvonne says fellow group members Imane “Pokimane” Anys and Lily “LilyPichu” Ki have experienced similar things with Fed.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">As a result, Fed has been removed from Offline TV.</h2><p>After Yvonne shared her statement, Offline TV posted a statement on their Twitter account.&nbsp;</p><p>"We strive to be a place where everyone can feel comfortable and safe. With that in mind, Fed has been removed from Offline TV," the tweet read. "He will also no longer be living with us.

"I’ve made it a point this year to be better, and as I often mention I’m trying to take more responsibility in my life," he continued. "I owe it to both my friends and everyone who supports me to own up to my actions, and that starts by listening to those I’ve hurt."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;"I want to make it clear that my intentions were never to act maliciously or predatorily," Fed said. "I am flawed, I have issues that impede my friendships, issues with myself, but I am not a predator and I never wanted this to happen."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you need support, The National Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 at 1-800-656-4673.
