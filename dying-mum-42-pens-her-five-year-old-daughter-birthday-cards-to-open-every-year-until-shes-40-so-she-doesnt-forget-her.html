I was going to the gym four times a week and swimming 50 lengths a day.&nbsp;I assumed it must be some wear and tear from all my exercise.</p><p>I was sent for an MRI scan which showed torn cartilage in my right knee, and was told not much could be done, but was given high-strength painkillers.</p><p>The first time alarm bells started ringing was in March 2016 when I was trying to put a plug in a socket and couldn’t – all the strength in my right hand and arm was gone.</p><p>Shortly after that I was messing around with Lexi, fell off the sofa and couldn’t get up. I went back to my doctor who referred me back to hospital for MRI scans and blood tests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472622225.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472622142-e1551359316630.jpg><p>I was told bluntly I had multiple sclerosis, which was horrific, but even then I felt something else was going on here.</p><p>By that point in a wheelchair, my illness prompted me to move from Kent, where we’d been living, to Nottingham, to be closer to my friends and family.</p><p>The stress of the illness led to Ryan and I separating.&nbsp;Life felt far from perfect on many fronts.</p><p>My mum had been a nurse and didn’t pull any punches when we spoke properly for the first time about my symptoms.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What some of Lene's cards to Lexi say:</h3></p><p><strong>For Lexi's 10th birthday:</strong></p><p>To my beautiful, gorgeous 10-year-old.</p><p>Enjoy your last year at primary school because next year the hard work begins!!</p><p>My love and thoughts are with you always.</p><p>Hugs and kisses, Mummy X</p><p><strong>For Lexi's 11th birthday:</strong></p><p>To my beautiful, gorgeous 11-year-old.</p><p>Wow, I remember your first day at school like it was yesterday!

I said I was worried it was MND, and he said yes, all the evidence points towards that.</p><p>All I can remember is breaking down, one hand held by Lisa and the other by the nurse.</p><p>Most people diagnosed with MND die within 12 to 18 months, and I should prepare myself for this, he said.</p><p>Ryan got the news that day and drove straight up to help me deal with things.</p><p>Over the next few weeks he brought me a takeaway and a glass of wine when I most needed it, and he was nothing short of amazing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472622010.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472622140.jpg><p>It took me the best part of two weeks for this news to properly sink in. All I could do was think about not seeing Lexi grow up.</p><p>Eventually I told her that mummy will have to go to heaven soon, but no child can understand death, what it really means until that massive hole has been left in their life.</p><p>But in the worst of times, you really find out who your friends are. I got countless messages from all my girlfriends in the coming weeks, who arranged a surprise visit to come and see me, despite my protests.</p><p>The four of us had all worked in Yates’ Wine Lodge 20 years previously and knew each other inside out.</p><p>They brought a couple of bottle of wine and we sat around my kitchen table, somehow managing to laugh about my predicament in a way that only best friends can.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472622216.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472622001.jpg><p>Very soon they said I had to come up with the best ever bucket list, all the things I wanted to do or share with Lexi before I died.</p><p>On my iPhone we made a list – take Lexi to Hamilton Island in Australia, where I’d worked for one of the best years of my life, take her to Disneyland Paris; go and see my sister Clare in Delaware in the US, have my first ever stripper and take her to Lapland UK for Christmas, if I ever survived that long.</p><p>But as well as filling her with magical memories of her mum, I wanted to leave mementos and notes for her to have at key points in her future.</p><p>So, I’ve written out a birthday card for every one of her birthdays until her 40th, and I’ve also given her my sapphire and diamond eternity ring and the teddy bear my mum gave me on my wedding day to have on hers.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What is MND?</h3></p><p>Motor neurone disease is a rare condition.</p><p>About two in every 100,000 Brits develop it each year.</p><p>It affects specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing the function of motor neurons to&nbsp;break down.</p><p>When this neurodegeneration occurs, everyday activities become increasingly difficult or completely impossible.</p><p>Over time, the condition progressively worsens as the muscle weakens and can visibly waste.</p><p>The majority of those diagnosed with the disease are given a three-year life expectancy starting from when they first notice the symptoms.</p><p>While motor neurone disease isn’t usually painful, symptoms can be extremely debilitating.</p><p>In many cases, signs of the disease will begin gradually.</p><p>Typically, this will occur on one side of the body only, before progressively worsening.</p><p>Heartbreakingly, motor neurone disease may leave the diagnosed unable to move or communicate property.</p><p>Swallowing and breathing may also become a difficult task.</p><p>The NHS outlines initial symptoms to look out for…</p><ul><li>a weakened grip, which can cause difficulty picking up or holding objects</li><li>weakness at the shoulder that makes lifting the arm difficult</li><li>a "foot drop" caused by weak ankle muscles</li><li>dragging of the leg</li><li>slurred speech (dysarthria)</li></ul><p>By focusing on lovely moments and her future I found I could somehow handle my own future better, that there was something to look forward to despite my impending early exit.</p><p>In April, for Lexi’s fifth birthday, we went to Disneyland Paris, and two months later we went to Australia. Writing all those cards was harder than I imagined because my hands don’t work anymore, so I’ve written them using my phone then&nbsp;amazing nurse at Nottinghamshire Hospice where I’m cared for has written them out for me, and I’ve signed each one ‘Mummy X’.</p><p>Thinking of her opening each one as when she’s 10, 12, 18, it breaks my heart, but I can’t let her forget me, the love burning inside me for her.</p><p>Ryan and I took Lexie to Lapland UK over Christmas and had a ‘pre-funeral’ party for the New Year with all my old friends and family.</p><p>We got drunk, laughed and danced in my memory, but with me there.</p><p>Of course, the longer I live the more I’ll add to my bucket list.
