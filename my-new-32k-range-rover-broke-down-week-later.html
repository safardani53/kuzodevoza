- which she pays <a href=#>£500-a-month for on finance</a> - when it slowed to a dangerous 30mph.</p><p>The car engine then started "smoking heavily" and water began pouring through the seal in her windscreen.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>After a string of unanswered calls a mechanic finally came to her aid but she was told he could do nothing

claims a "sexist" branch manager "belittled her" after she demanded a refund.</p><p>She slammed: "He walked straight past me and handed my partner the keys, he blanked me when I was asking questions."</p><p>Reanne claimed: "His exact words were ‘I have been working with cars for the past 28 years so I know everything there is to do with this, you on the other don’t so I’d listen to what I have to say’.</p><p>"I was feeling extremely belittled in the situation where he refused to talk to me about my car due to me being a young woman."</p><p>Asked whether she felt sexism was involved - she replied "yes".</p><p>Reanne was then handed a "absolutely nothing" ‘like for like’ Kia Sportage which she had to drive for three weeks while her car got fixed.</p><h2 id=car-crash>Car Crash</h2><p>But when she finally got her <a href=#>Range Rover back she claims it was an absolute tip</a>.</p><p>She said: "There were pieces of sealant inside, <a href=#>the car was dirty, there were leaves all over, it was clear they hadn't cleaned up even the mess they made</a>.</p><p>"I opened the boot when I got home to find the engine cover in there - they hadn’t put the engine cover back on."</p><p>Reanne paid £35 to get her car cleaned and admits there is "no point asking them" to cough up.</p><p>And despite chasing the dealership she says "I have heard absolutely nothing on a refund" from the £200 hotel she missed out on.</p><p>She claims mechanics have since been out four more times because there are still issues with the car.</p><p>Frustrated Reanne said: "Safe to say I have been utterly disgusted with the product and the service .</p><p>"A handful of people asked me what I thought of mine as they were going to get one, and I told them this story and they said never
