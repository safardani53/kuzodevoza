Despite a few fine lines at the edges of his eyes, he’s still as good-looking as I remember.</p><p>I’ve scribbled down on my notepad, “Was it me that led to the break-up?” — and it quickly becomes clear that it was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/993e8a77-e69b-400a-98f6-3581cce00488.jpg><p>“You upset me, you lashed out, and I always regret how things ended,” Ben says. “It really did hurt at the time.”</p><p>But I never knew that he was hurt. I just wanted his attention and must have gone about getting it in silly ways.</p><p>During our eight months together, I never felt good enough or believed he loved me, so I cooked up a series of childish stunts to keep him interested.</p><p>When he couldn’t make a family <a href=#>holiday</a>, I invited a mutual male friend in his place.</p><p>It was the singer from the band Ben drummed in, no less. This teenage bid to provoke him worked and, after I returned home, he broke up with me publicly at a house party.</p><p>“I was so into you, but by the end I was just enduring it,” he says. “You pushed me out of love with you. I didn’t date for a year after we split up, as I didn’t want to risk feeling like that again.”</p><p>It now shocks me to learn just how much I must have hurt him. I like to think I’ve matured, as I realise that my spoiled teenage self wouldn’t have lasted five minutes in a <a href=#>marriage</a>.</p><p>Happily, Ben ended up marrying a girl who he had been friends with for years and they now have two <a href=#>lovely children</a>.</p><h2>THE GRASS ISN’T GREENER</h2><p>I MET my next long-term boyfriend, Sam, at university. But I foolishly dumped him after two years.</p><p>I wanted to “experience more”, but didn’t realise just how good I already had it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/writer-amy-nickell-revisited-ex-772688521.jpg><p>Sam has been in a long-term relationship for ages and he and his partner may even be married by now.</p><p>My <a href=#>social media</a> stalking isn’t very successful because I think he’s restricted what I can see. After I contact him, he writes: “Is it for a feature? I could have guessed.”</p><p>My reply is left unread and I don’t blame him. I’ve spent the last ten years feeling guilty about the way things ended.</p><p>The whole “grass is greener” syndrome is a common reason that relationships end prematurely, leaving potential for long-term regret. Could this be why the average UK marriage only lasts a little over 11 years?</p><p>Looking back, I allowed this toxic mindset to ruin an otherwise healthy and loving relationship.</p><p>Now, I realise I should never shift focus from what I have to what I might be missing.</p><h2>YOU NEED A THICK SKIN</h2><p>AFTER Sam and I split up, the next decade of dating resulted in an unplanned <a href=#>pregnancy</a>, in 2014.</p><p>My son’s dad chose not to be involved, so I got on with life as a single mum. One of my first flings when my son was still a toddler was with a struggling musician.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/writer-amy-nickell-revisited-ex-772687966.jpg><p>We dated for a couple of months before things fizzled out.</p><p>That struggling musician went on to be an <a href=#>X Factor</a> finalist. He soon appeared on a few other big reality shows and he briefly became a low-key national treasure.</p><p>But apparently I’ve faded from his memory.</p><p>“Er, it was, like, six years ago, I don’t even remember tbh,” he replies with thinly veiled contempt.</p><p>It stings to read it.</p><p><a href=#>Dr John Gottmann</a>, author of Why Marriages Succeed Or Fail, believes contempt is one of the negative emotions most likely to lead to divorce.</p><p>In fact, it’s the number one predictor of divorce within the first six years of a marriage.</p><p>Now I can see why.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>DON’T POOL YOUR MONEY</h2><p>I THINK I’m getting somewhere with a guy, David, I dated for a year in 2017.</p><p>For a start, it sounds like I’d made a decent first impression. He tells me: “You were fit, cool, funny, very, very confident and eccentric, which I liked.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/writer-amy-nickell-revisited-ex-772687957.jpg><p>The conversation then moves back and forth until he says he’d “rather not revisit things”.</p><p>He adds: “It was such a painful time for me. I really cared about you and I’m still sad about how things ended.”</p><p>I’d ended things over a row about <a href=#>money</a>, after David asked me to give him spending money for a holiday together.</p><p>I felt that he wasn’t pulling his weight financially, which very quickly caused <a href=#>resentment</a>.</p><p>After that, it feels wrong to prod for any more information.</p><p>It’s no surprise to learn that <a href=#>money-related conflicts</a> were recently cited as the number one reason why couples divorce.</p><p>Experts recommend one way to avoid this is by having three bank accounts — one each and one for shared expenses.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>DON’T CHANGE FOR ANYONE</h2><p>WHEN my son was slightly older, I fell into the arms of a local barman called Chris.</p><p>His work kept moving him around the country, and although we tried to keep seeing each other long-distance, things eventually fizzled out.</p><p>We still speak on the phone and I’d always believed if he’d stuck in one place long enough, we’d have stayed together.</p><p>Five years on, we agree to meet in the bar where we first met. I told him my theory about why we broke up. He casts his eyes down in guilt.</p><p>“I’m sorry Amy, for me it was never going to go anywhere, it was just fun,” he says. “Honestly, I could never accept that you were a mother.”</p><p>This is certainly news to me, as Chris never even hinted he had a problem with me being a <a href=#>parent</a>.</p><p>I feel like a fool, and want to get away from him, the bar and the whole experience.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>LEARNING FROM MY MISTAKES</h2><p>EXPERIMENT over, I tell my fiancé Jonathan what Chris said and ask whether he’s ever had similar concerns.</p><p>Much to my relief he tells me that while he’d never wanted kids before we met — so much so that he had a <a href=#>vasectomy</a> — he now loves my Star Wars-mad seven-year-old.</p><p>Reflecting on my past threw up some home truths and some of the new information was hard to swallow — especially hearing how I’d hurt others.</p><p>But I also realised that while I’ve given my time to too many fools in the past, my experiences have helped give me a much stronger chance of making my marriage work.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>I’m now with the right guy, who can keep his cool with my drama and always sees the positive in every situation, and I know I definitely won’t be repeating my mistakes from the past. So bring on those wedding bells.</p><ul><li>Additional reporting: Claire Dunwell</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FpamxwYWV%2FcK%2FOp6uam6SasW6x156qZqWZqMGit8SsZKaZoqe2orPEaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcontacted-exes-mistakes-marriage.html&text=I%27m%20getting%20married%20but%20I%20don%27t%20want%20to%20repeat%20past%20mistakes...%20so%20I%20asked%20all%20my%20exes%20where%20I%20went%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcontacted-exes-mistakes-marriage.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcontacted-exes-mistakes-marriage.html&title=I%27m%20getting%20married%20but%20I%20don%27t%20want%20to%20repeat%20past%20mistakes...%20so%20I%20asked%20all%20my%20exes%20where%20I%20went%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcontacted-exes-mistakes-marriage.html&title=I%27m%20getting%20married%20but%20I%20don%27t%20want%20to%20repeat%20past%20mistakes...%20so%20I%20asked%20all%20my%20exes%20where%20I%20went%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcontacted-exes-mistakes-marriage.html&title=I%27m%20getting%20married%20but%20I%20don%27t%20want%20to%20repeat%20past%20mistakes...%20so%20I%20asked%20all%20my%20exes%20where%20I%20went%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcontacted-exes-mistakes-marriage.html&description=I%27m%20getting%20married%20but%20I%20don%27t%20want%20to%20repeat%20past%20mistakes...%20so%20I%20asked%20all%20my%20exes%20where%20I%20went%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./martin-lundstedt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Martin Lundstedt">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./emily-blunt-shows-off-pregnant-bikini-body-john-krasinski-bradley-cooper-go-shirtless-hawaii-pictures-20132011.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emily Blunt Pregnant Bikini Body Pictures With Krasinski, Cooper">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
