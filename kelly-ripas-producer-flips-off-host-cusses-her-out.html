#LetsTalkOffCamera BTS @wiener_jan @abtvhd," the post showed <a href=#>Kelly</a>, 52, and television producers Albert and Jan Schillay Wiener attempting—and failing—to meditate.</p><p>Albert appeared keen to commit to the exercise as he played the guided meditation from his smartphone.</p><p>A seemingly half-interested Kelly stated: "I'm going to lay down," as she lied back on the floor.</p><p>Jan openly admitted: "This isn't going to work," as the three friends and colleagues started the meditation session.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON KELLY RIPA">READ MORE ON KELLY RIPA</h2><p>The instructor could be heard instructing the trio to: "Find a quiet place to sit down," to which Kelly immediately responded: "Already I hate it," and requested that the instructor be changed to someone with a British accent.</p><p>The change is made but both the TV host and Jan are shown laughing quietly as Albert intently tried to remain focused.</p><p>Albert yelled: "Be quiet!" as the pair's snickers transformed into uncontrolled guffaws.</p><p>After being told to "pretend that you are a gentle observer" Jan confessed: "I can't," and excused herself allowing Kelly to sit next to Albert.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Later he exclaimed: "Close your eyes!" and gave Kelly a light punch as he again attempted to refocus the meditation.</p><p>The former All My Children actress asked: "What part of meditation is when your partner hits you?"</p><p>Jan returned to "meditate" as Albert demanded that she and Kelly put something on their heads.</p><p>Kelly and Jan are shown doing just that as they put on Mandalorian helmets and started to physically work out during the remainder of the meditation session.</p><p>Albert flipped them both off from his crossed-legged sitting position and later yelled: "Screw you!" after the session was over and Kelly tried to tell him "Good job."</p><p>As the video concluded, Albert was shown calling his meditation partners a "bunch of f**king a**holes," as Kelly and Jan cracked up laughing.</p><h2>MORNING MAYHEM</h2><p>Last week, Kelly insisted "I know I'm on camera!" to a Live producer as she admitted she "doesn't know what to do" <a href=#>during an unusual show moment</a>.</p><p>Kelly and&nbsp;<a href=#>Mark Consuelos</a>, also 52, were joined by Maxine the Fluffy Corgi and her owner Bryan Reisburg who were in the studio to teach the hosts how to create a viral video.</p><p>To create the eye-catching moment, Bryan placed the corgi in a backpack, strapped the pack onto Mark's back, had both the host and the dog put on sunglasses, and pointed a fan, blowing confetti, at their faces.</p><p>Bryan announced: "If it feels stupid you're doing something right," as he recorded Mark.</p><p>Kelly stepped aside as her husband added to the madness by mounting a scooter with Maxine still on his back.</p><p>She looked overwhelmed as she watched the confusion happening on stage.</p><p>The host then called out to the show's producer: "I know I'm on camera Gelman but I don't know what to do with my hands," as she waved them back and forth.</p><p>After the video was recorded Bryan admitted: "Frequently when you're filming with a dog, like right now, it's going to be a mess but you get what you get, and you post it, and you hope for something good."</p><p>Mark asked the audience: "Are we going viral?" prompting the audience to cheer in response.</p><p>Kelly's fans have&nbsp;<a href=#>begged for the host to return to Live</a>&nbsp;after she was absent during Thursday's broadcast.</p><p>The TV personality was&nbsp;<a href=#>missing from the show</a>&nbsp;so she could&nbsp;<a href=#>present her game show, Generation Gap</a>.</p><p>Comedian and presenter Anderson Cooper stepped in for Kelly&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>Live</a>&nbsp;opposite her co-host, husband&nbsp;Mark.</p><p>On Thursday night, Kelly shared a video of herself on the set of Generation Gap.</p><p>The mother of three smiled at the camera as she panned it around to the cheering live audience, with her dad Joe sitting in an armchair among them.</p><p>She posted the clip on Instagram and wrote: "Drop it low for a new Generation Gap tonight."</p><p>The competition features children working with their grandparents to answer questions about pop culture.</p><p>While many fans praised her show in the comments, others begged for the star to return to Live.</p><p>One wrote: "Miss you on Live! Come Back! Mark is doing a great Job."</p><p>Another added, "Why weren't you on Live it wasn't the same!" and a third asked: "Are you ever coming back?"</p><p>Hours before her appearance on the game show, Kelly was&nbsp;<a href=#>photographed going for a stroll</a>&nbsp;in New York City.</p><p>Kelly looked stunning in a lace-trim floral dress and sunglasses as she soaked up the sun.</p><h2>BIG DREAMS</h2><p>Kelly recently&nbsp;<a href=#>teased that she might leave</a>&nbsp;her decades-long run on the show if she was hit with good fortune.</p><p>In a previous episode, the soap star told the audience that she "might not be here tomorrow."</p><p>"Listen, just so you know," she said as she picked up a piece of paper from the desk.</p><p>"I probably won't be here tomorrow or forever because I'm going to hit the $900 million Powerball."</p><p>The audience cheered as Mark chuckled.</p><p>Kelly said she would move to the South of France while Mark stayed in New York to host the show with Jenny Mollen.</p><p>"Nobody will even notice I'm gone. They'll just think I've had work done," Kelly joked.</p><p>"It'll be amazing. I've got this whole thing figured out."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She continued: "I'll miss you all, but thank you."</p><p>No one won the Powerball that night, and Kelly&nbsp;<a href=#>returned to the show</a>&nbsp;the following day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/taken-without-permission-live-producer-835336528.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/taken-without-permission-live-producer-835336529.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/show-shakeup-live-s-kelly-834068232-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZ2h9eH%2BTaKKepJyuerO1z5qqZqiipLG2r8SrZJ%2BkmaXAbrvFn2Shp6OpeqTB0qycrGWYmr9uu9StZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkelly-ripas-producer-flips-off-host-cusses-her-out.html&text=Kelly%20Ripa%27s%20producer%20flips%20off%20host%20and%20cusses%20her%20out%20as%20Live%20star%20drops%20to%20the%20floor%20in%20wild%20behi&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkelly-ripas-producer-flips-off-host-cusses-her-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkelly-ripas-producer-flips-off-host-cusses-her-out.html&title=Kelly%20Ripa%27s%20producer%20flips%20off%20host%20and%20cusses%20her%20out%20as%20Live%20star%20drops%20to%20the%20floor%20in%20wild%20behi" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkelly-ripas-producer-flips-off-host-cusses-her-out.html&title=Kelly%20Ripa%27s%20producer%20flips%20off%20host%20and%20cusses%20her%20out%20as%20Live%20star%20drops%20to%20the%20floor%20in%20wild%20behi" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkelly-ripas-producer-flips-off-host-cusses-her-out.html&title=Kelly%20Ripa%27s%20producer%20flips%20off%20host%20and%20cusses%20her%20out%20as%20Live%20star%20drops%20to%20the%20floor%20in%20wild%20behi" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkelly-ripas-producer-flips-off-host-cusses-her-out.html&description=Kelly%20Ripa%27s%20producer%20flips%20off%20host%20and%20cusses%20her%20out%20as%20Live%20star%20drops%20to%20the%20floor%20in%20wild%20behi" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kunal-bakshi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kunal Bakshi">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./harold-brazier.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harold Brazier">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
