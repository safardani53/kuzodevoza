It looked like you could put your hands in and grab my spinal cord.</p><p>"One breast is completely different then the other and pops out of my bra all the time which is embarrassing.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>"How do you move forward with such horrific scars?"</p><p>Dale said there were four medics in the room before the operation - but claims there was only one when she woke up.</p><p>The mum claims the staff had "plans" and prioritised their social lives over her health, leaving her wounds half-stitched before she was sent home.</p><p>"It was a day where they all had to rush out and be somewhere," Dale said.</p><p>"I’m sure I was bleeding when I was wheeled out and thrown into my friend's car."</p><p>Dale's pal pleaded with her to go to the hospital - but she refused as she couldn't afford to pay for treatment and believed her insurance wouldn't cover complications from plastic surgery.</p><p>She had no choice but to return to the clinic to have the wound sewn up again.</p><p>But it then split open for a second time.</p><p>Dale said the pain was "awful" and the hole in her back was left wide open for a whole summer.</p><p>The wound had started to tear from both sides before it was finally closed by the same surgeon, she said.</p><p>She was finally given a wound vac machine to help heal her injuries - which pulls fluid from the wound over time and keeps it clean.</p><p>But Dale described it as "utterly disgusting and smelly" - and claims it was the final straw for her husband.</p><p>"He was disgusted by me," she said.</p><p>"The worst part is that I did this because my marriage was falling apart, but the smell and look of the wound vac pretty much was the nail in the coffin of my marriage."</p><p>And once the wound was healed she was left with “horrific scars" and advised by the surgeon to have laser scar removal.</p><p>The procedure was carried out by a nurse from the first op - and Dale believes it was the surgeon's way of trying to make up for the horrific damage she had caused.</p><p>But the mum allegedly caught the nurse altering the images of her scarring on an iPad to make it look less severe.</p><p>The 54-year-old feels she was "lured” into the practice through “fake kindness” and free gifts of skincare products worth $120.</p><p>She said: "They were so sweet and said ‘look how beautiful you are’ - just over the top kind, and the kindness was fake.</p><p>"I honestly believe that they knew they had a desperate, insecure woman on their hands, so they saw dollar signs.</p><p>"I got scammed so bad."</p><p>Dale said she was fooled by the "brand new and pristine" office at the practice and had felt like she was in safe hands.</p><p>"This was supposed to be me going to the beach in the summer and now I can't even wear a two piece because I’m paranoid about the scars," she said.</p><p>Dale explained that she has struggled with body confidence issues since her childhood - and now her self-esteem is "in the toilet".</p><p>"The scars on the inside are worse than the ones on the outside," she said.</p><p>"How do I explain to a man why I’m so scarred? The thought of taking my clothes off in front of anyone causes me major anxiety.”</p><p>The ordeal has affected every aspect of her life - including her career.&nbsp;</p><p>She used to be a high-flying business woman but had to give this up due to her poor health and now works a part time job in a UPS store.</p><p>"If you have to do something like that to hold onto a man then it’s not worth it," Dale warned.</p><p>"I want women to know that to just love yourself the way you are.</p><p>"You don’t have to be perfect and have plastic surgery.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“We all age and there’s beauty in ageing and also strength in ageing."</p><p>The surgeon declined to comment when approached by The Sun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3c4ca7a1-0437-4afe-80fd-c22e4050807b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1c4a361e-4100-42ba-9cff-dc52cbd4ba40-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/e26d8cc0-b0b9-4efa-a20b-10666146e097.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/dd346742-bf40-45fe-b165-d9c1b5685b3e-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/husband-left-couldnt-cope-smell-847763561.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/NINTCHDBPICT000847743805.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIZyhJhsZ29nna56o7vTnJ%2BenF2owrOzxKuwZqCfp7%2BqstiipaBll5a9qrrGZq6orZ6ZwHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmy-botched-surgery-horrifying-gaping-wounds.html&text=My%20botched%20boob%20job%20op%20left%20me%20with%20horror%20gaping%20wounds%20-%20my%20husband%20walked%20out%20because%20he%20couldn%27t&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmy-botched-surgery-horrifying-gaping-wounds.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmy-botched-surgery-horrifying-gaping-wounds.html&title=My%20botched%20boob%20job%20op%20left%20me%20with%20horror%20gaping%20wounds%20-%20my%20husband%20walked%20out%20because%20he%20couldn%27t" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmy-botched-surgery-horrifying-gaping-wounds.html&title=My%20botched%20boob%20job%20op%20left%20me%20with%20horror%20gaping%20wounds%20-%20my%20husband%20walked%20out%20because%20he%20couldn%27t" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmy-botched-surgery-horrifying-gaping-wounds.html&title=My%20botched%20boob%20job%20op%20left%20me%20with%20horror%20gaping%20wounds%20-%20my%20husband%20walked%20out%20because%20he%20couldn%27t" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmy-botched-surgery-horrifying-gaping-wounds.html&description=My%20botched%20boob%20job%20op%20left%20me%20with%20horror%20gaping%20wounds%20-%20my%20husband%20walked%20out%20because%20he%20couldn%27t" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./natalie-ortega.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natalie Ortega">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jaylen-brown-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Info on Celtics Stars Personal Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
