He said she would have to play later when they had dinner.</p><p>"I reminded him that Laura would not be on her own due to her age. I said I would always need to be close by.<br>"I was told this could only happen if I joined the meet and greet team."<br>He told Dawn arrangements were made for a harp to be used at the event and he offered to pick the instrument up from the family home.<br>Dawn, who works in social research, added: "He warned me that we must not visit the hotel until we had met him at the train station to take our pictures and sort out identification.<br>"When I sent him an email to say we were on our way, his response said Miley Byrne at the top.<br>"I text him to ask why it said Miley Byrne on his email and he told me it was his partner.<br>"He then sent me a message saying he hoped there were no problems.<br>"Clearly he knew we were onto him.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Related stories</h2></p><p>"After putting his name into Google, it came up with stories about him terrorising hotel staff.<br>"I was absolutely horrified, stunned and appalled.<br>"I then phoned the police and phoned the hotel which Laura was due to play at.<br>"I was very thorough and did as much as I could.<br>"We were so lucky that we uncovered him. I felt physically sick and numb at the same time."<br>After revealing Byrne's true nature, Dawn said the family went through "hell".<br>Dawn and husband Gary, 54, were petrified he would visit their home and got special leave for her daughter to avoid attending a harp concert.<br>She started to take Laura, now 16, with her everywhere and would not let her leave the home alone.</p><p>She said: "The whole family lost sleep.</p><p>"It was a very traumatic and stressful time for us all.<br>"He even told us he was Boris Johnson's bodyguard.<br>"Without wanting to scare Laura, I feel sick when I think what might have been if we had agreed to be collected by this man.<br>"He has slipped through the net for years. It is shocking and scary.<br>"Not all parents like me monitor Facebook and this was Laura's music page, not a personal one, so it should have been more secure.</p><p>"Here is an example of how social media can go horribly wrong when not monitored."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict0002531870951.jpg><p>Byrne, who was spared jail twice after impersonating police - on one occasion he claimed to be guarding</p><p>the daughter of the US Ambassador - has now finally been put behind bars.<br>Chelmsford Crown Court was told that yet again Byrne, of Braintree, Essex, had been posing as somebody else.<br>And this time, masquerading under his false identity, he stole thousands of pounds from his bosses.<br>Recorder Maryam Syed told him there were "aggravating features", including his previous convictions over the past seven years, for which he had only served a short time behind bars after breaching earlier court orders.</p><p>The court heard as well as two previous offences of impersonating police, there had been other incidents where he had made false representation.<br>In April 2009, he was caught with a hoard of police equipment in his car including handcuffs and an extendable baton.<br>It was searched when police investigated reports of a vehicle driving with blue flashing lights.<br>And in May 2013, he burst into a hotel posing as a policeman, handcuffed a guest to the inside of a lift, then offered the receptionist £50 to take off her underwear.<br>Dressed in uniform and carrying handcuffs he carried out the fantasy in a Travelodge in Essex for six hours.<br>Now Byrne has admitted stealing £5,290 while working as a bookkeeper for Chelmsford-based Ancient Purety nutritional specialists between July 1 and August 15, last year.<br>He transferred 11 amounts to his account in the name of Adam Wild.<br>He had given this name, said the judge, to prevent revealing his true identity which would have revealed his criminal record.<br>Sentencing, Recorder Syed told Byrne: "I accept there may have been a Walter Mitty aspect to past offences but this was intentional and persistent."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoF3hZRqaWiekaPBor%2FIrKtmqJ%2BosqV5wKxkm6einsButs6hpaynnqh6o7vDsp6umaKZerW7jK2psmWRo7FuwNGinJ1lpKR6rcHRnmRqbV2usqK%2BjKijnWWYlr%2BxtdKtZK2nXZZ6rbvNnaanZZikwaa4jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffantasist-posed-as-boris-johnsons-bodyguard-to-try-and-tried-to-lure-15-year-old-harpist-to-a-london-hotel.html&text=Fantasist%20posed%20as%20Boris%20Johnsons%20bodyguard%20to%20try%20to%20lure%2015-year-old%20harpist%20to%20a%20London%20hot&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffantasist-posed-as-boris-johnsons-bodyguard-to-try-and-tried-to-lure-15-year-old-harpist-to-a-london-hotel.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffantasist-posed-as-boris-johnsons-bodyguard-to-try-and-tried-to-lure-15-year-old-harpist-to-a-london-hotel.html&title=Fantasist%20posed%20as%20Boris%20Johnsons%20bodyguard%20to%20try%20to%20lure%2015-year-old%20harpist%20to%20a%20London%20hot" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffantasist-posed-as-boris-johnsons-bodyguard-to-try-and-tried-to-lure-15-year-old-harpist-to-a-london-hotel.html&title=Fantasist%20posed%20as%20Boris%20Johnsons%20bodyguard%20to%20try%20to%20lure%2015-year-old%20harpist%20to%20a%20London%20hot" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffantasist-posed-as-boris-johnsons-bodyguard-to-try-and-tried-to-lure-15-year-old-harpist-to-a-london-hotel.html&title=Fantasist%20posed%20as%20Boris%20Johnsons%20bodyguard%20to%20try%20to%20lure%2015-year-old%20harpist%20to%20a%20London%20hot" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffantasist-posed-as-boris-johnsons-bodyguard-to-try-and-tried-to-lure-15-year-old-harpist-to-a-london-hotel.html&description=Fantasist%20posed%20as%20Boris%20Johnsons%20bodyguard%20to%20try%20to%20lure%2015-year-old%20harpist%20to%20a%20London%20hot" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./freddy-cricien.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Freddy Cricien">&larr;
