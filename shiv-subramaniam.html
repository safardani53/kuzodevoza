He is best known for creating the character of businessman I.M Virani for the Colors TV network’s Mukti Bandhan in 2011.&nbsp;His main parts in the industry include his portrayal of Ananya’s father in the film 2 States, Mr. Bose in Adolescent Patti, Peter in That Girl in Yellow Footwear, and Head Of School in Hichki.</p><p>Aside from this, we have mentioned a few more films in which he worked and received a lot of praise.
