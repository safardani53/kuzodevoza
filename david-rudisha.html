He trained with Japheth Kimutai, who later recommended him to James Templeton by the two.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Consequently, David was a part of a group of runners that Templeton managed. The team used to include athletes such as Bernard Lagat, Kimutai, and Augustine Choge.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Initially, David became a 400-meter runner.
